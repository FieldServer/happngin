HAPPNER SECURITY
----------------

users groups and permissions
----------------------------
*happner meshes can run in secure mode, a scheme comprising of users, groups and permissions allows for this, we have yet to complete the documentation for this, but to get a comprehensive picture of how this works, please look at [the test for now](https://github.com/happner/happner/blob/master/test/b4-permissions-translation.js)*

payload encryption
------------------
*happners messaging payload can be encrypted, the mesh must be running in secure mode, to see how this works client to mesh, please look at [the test](https://github.com/happner/happner/blob/master/test/c9-payload-encryption-client-to-mesh.js) - there is also a test demonstrating how this works [mesh to mesh](https://github.com/happner/happner/blob/master/test/c8-payload-encryption-mesh-to-mesh.js)*
