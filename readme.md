# happner

*Happner* is a cloud application framework ideal for integrating multiple micro services into a unified offering. It enables the creation of an interconnected mesh of components capable of interacting both locally and remotely. The mesh components can easily call upon each other's methods or listen to each other's events in a manner uncomplicated by remoteness.

*Happner* also provides a set of built in components to facilitate providing the resources necessary to build a user interface. This includes the Happngin api client which enables browsers to connect natively to the mesh.
